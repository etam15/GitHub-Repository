You wake up in the base of a military lab. Can&apos;t believe you&apos;re alive, huh? From a sign outside you realize you&apos;re in Area 51. You feel as if 4 small parts of your body has been extracted right out of you but you don&apos;t know what&apos;s happened. You don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on. But what you do know is that you need to replemish what you&apos;ve lost and get the hell out of this base. The sign outside Area 51 was already intimidating. Now you&apos;re in the base of the operation. The people here will do anything to kill you. It seems that everybody&apos;s out and the security cameras are offâ€¦ for now. No time to poop your pants. Get out of here.

Area 51 HQ
An Interactive Fiction by Eric Tam
Release 1 / Serial number 131011 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Center of The Military Lab
You&apos;re in the center of the Military Lab. It&apos;s quite the large room. 50 meters by 50 meters, maybe? How trippy. You wonder what went on here. There&apos;s some blood stains along the floor, but nothing like a murder scene. Where should you go now? You may go in all four directions: N, S, W, and E.

You can see a S Door, Titanium Box (closed), a Green Light, an Ice Tongs and a Chemical Tray Belt here.

Creature Testing Facility
You&apos;re in the Creature Testing Facility. You know that because there&apos;s a sign on the bottom that seems like it was ripped off. There&apos;s really nothing else rather than that the walls are made of spiderwebs (3x stronger than steel!) Care to go West? Curiousity could kill you. The Military Lab&apos;s Center is back east.
