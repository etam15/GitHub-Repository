"Area 51 HQ" by Eric Tam

[introductory content]

When play begins: say "You wake up in the base of a military lab. Can't believe you're alive, huh? From a sign outside you realize you're in Area 51. You feel as if 4 small parts of your body has been extracted right out of you but you don't know what's happened. You don't know what's going on. But what you do know is that you need to replemish what you've lost and get the hell out of this base using chemicals. The sign outside Area 51 was already intimidating. Now you're in the base of the operation. The military will do anything to kill you. It seems that everybody's out and the security cameras are offâ€¦ for now. No time to poop your pants. Get out of here. But, be VERY careful."

The Description of the player is "You're a normal tan-skinned person (5'10, 180 lbs), wearing clothes that you don't feel like you normally wear. They must have given you them. The pockets on these are rather large. Maybe you could store a lot of things inside. There's a huge cut in your arm. Gross. Your fingerprints look odd."

[first room]
The Center of The Military Lab is a room. "You're in the center of the Military Lab. It's quite the large room. 50 meters by 50 meters, maybe? How trippy. You wonder what went on here.  Where should you go now?

It's also quite cold in here. You hear the sound of an air conditioner from far away but it's still quite loud.
