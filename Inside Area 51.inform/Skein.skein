You wake up in the base of a military lab. Can&apos;t believe you&apos;re alive, huh? From a sign outside you realize you&apos;re in Area 51. You feel as if 4 small parts of your body has been extracted right out of you but you don&apos;t know what&apos;s happened. You don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on. But what you do know from science is that you need to replemish what you&apos;ve lost and get the hell out of this base using chemicals because something about you is strange. Yeah, your fingerprints don&apos;t even look right. The sign outside Area 51 was already intimidating. Now you&apos;re in the base of the operation. The military will do anything to kill you. It seems that everybody&apos;s out and the security cameras are off… for now. No time to poop your pants. Get out of here. But, be VERY careful.န冐

Inside Area 51
An Interactive Fiction by Eric Tam
Release 1 / Serial number 131018 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Center of The Military Lab
You&apos;re in the center of the Military Lab. It&apos;s quite the large room. 50 meters by 50 meters, maybe? How trippy. You wonder what went on here, considering a small amount of blood on the floor.  Where to go, chief?

You may go in all four directions: N, S, W, and E.

You can see a S Door, a Titanium Box (closed), a beaker, a Green Light and a small amount of blood here.

Nuclear Machinery
You&apos;re in the Nuclear Machinery Room. You don&apos;t want to touch anything because everything looks so intimidating and so big. Even when you whisper the room echoes your voice.. There sure aren&apos;t any weapons around this room. The room is very big and filled with vehicles in a color that is quite unusual. It&apos;s also quite cold in here. You hear the sound of an air conditioner from far away but it&apos;s still quite loud.

The Center of The Military lab is back west. Another room seems to be at the next east turn.

You can see a SHARP Air Conditioner, Table (on which is a suitcase (closed)), an Alpha Tank and a Jeep here.

Creature Testing facility
You&apos;re in the Creature Testing Facility. You only know that because the floor is labeled CREATURE TESTING FACILITY. But somehow this place is generally empty. There&apos;s really nothing else rather than that the walls are made of spiderwebs (3x stronger than steel) Whatever&apos;s up ahead is probably gonna be something dangerous.

The Military Lab&apos;s Center is back east. Another room seems to be at the next west turn.

You can see a big amount of spiderwebs and a sign here.

You hear the sound of an air conditioner from far away but it&apos;s still quite loud.

The Center of The Military lab is back west. Another room seems to be at the next east turn.

You can see Table (on which is a suitcase (closed)), an Alpha Tank and a Jeep here.

Center of The Military Lab
You&apos;re in the center of the Military Lab. It&apos;s quite the large room. 50 meters by 50 meters, maybe? How trippy. You wonder what went on here, considering a small amount of blood on the floor.  Where to go, chief?

You may go in all four directions: N, S, W, and E.

You can see a S Door, a Titanium Box (closed), a beaker, a Green Light and a small amount of blood here.

Glassware Room
This room is not very big. It&apos;s full of glass containers. The room is of a tinted blue.

The Center of The Military Lab is back south. Another room seems to be up ahead.

You can see a N Door, a blue light, a large number of glass containers, a Test Tube Rack and a Broken Glass here.
