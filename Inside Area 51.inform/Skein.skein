You wake up in the base of a military lab. Can&apos;t believe you&apos;re alive, huh? From a sign outside you realize you&apos;re in Area 51. You feel as if 4 small parts of your body has been extracted right out of you but you don&apos;t know what&apos;s happened. You don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on. But what you do know from science is that you need to replemish what you&apos;ve lost and get the hell out of this base using chemicals because something about you is strange. Yeah, your fingerprints don&apos;t even look right. The sign outside Area 51 was already intimidating. Now you&apos;re in the base of the operation. The military will do anything to kill you. It seems that everybody&apos;s out and the security cameras are off… for now. No time to poop your pants. Get out of here. But, be VERY careful.翸᠀ints d

Inside Area 51
An Interactive Fiction by Eric Tam
Release 1 / Serial number 131018 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Center of The Military Lab
You&apos;re in the center of the Military Lab. It&apos;s quite the large room. 50 meters by 50 meters, maybe? How trippy. You wonder what went on here, considering a small amount of blood on the floor.  Where to go, chief?

You may go in all four directions: N, S, W, and E.

You can see a S Door, a Titanium Box (closed), a beaker, a Green Light and a small amount of blood here.

Nuclear Machinery
You&apos;re in the Nuclear Machinery Room. You don&apos;t want to touch anything because everything looks so intimidating and so big. Even when you whisper the room echoes your voice.. There sure aren&apos;t any weapons around this room. The room is very big and filled with vehicles in a color that is quite unusual. It&apos;s also quite cold in here. You hear the sound of an air conditioner from far away but it&apos;s still quite loud.

The Center of The Military lab is back west. Another room seems to be at the next east turn.

You can see a SHARP Air Conditioner, Table (on which is a suitcase (closed)), an Alpha Tank and a Jeep here.

West Room
This room is quite the room indeed. It has such a high ceiling with walls made of durable lead (imagine how heavy that is).

The Creature Testing Facility is back east.

You can see Lead, a teleporter and KRAM here.

Creature Testing facility
You&apos;re in the Creature Testing Facility. You only know that because the floor is labeled CREATURE TESTING FACILITY. But somehow this place is generally empty. There&apos;s really nothing else rather than that the walls are made of spiderwebs (3x stronger than steel) Whatever&apos;s up ahead is probably gonna be something dangerous.

The Military Lab&apos;s Center is back east. Another room seems to be at the next west turn.

You can see a big amount of spiderwebs and a sign here.

Center of The Military Lab
You&apos;re in the center of the Military Lab. It&apos;s quite the large room. 50 meters by 50 meters, maybe? How trippy. You wonder what went on here.  Where should you go now?

You may go in all four directions: N, S, W, and E.

You can see a S Door, a Titanium Box (closed), a beaker, a Green Light and a blood here.

You&apos;re in the Creature Testing Facility. You only know that because the floor is labeled CREATURE TESTING FACILITY. But somehow this place is generally empty. There&apos;s really nothing else rather than that the walls are made of spiderwebs (3x stronger than steel) Whatever&apos;s up ahead is probably gonna be something dangerous.

The Military Lab&apos;s Center is back east. Another room seems to be at the next west turn.

You can see a big amount of spiderwebs and a sign here.
