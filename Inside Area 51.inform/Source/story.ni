"Inside Area 51" by Eric Tam

Release along with cover art.

[introductory content]

The maximum score is 13.

When play begins: say "You wake up in the base of a military lab. Can't believe you're alive, huh? From a sign outside you realize you're in Area 51. You feel as if 4 small parts of your body has been extracted right out of you but you don't know what's happened. You don't know what's going on. But what you do know from science is that you need to replemish what you've lost and get the hell out of this base using chemicals because something about you is strange. Yeah, your fingerprints don't even look right. The sign outside Area 51 was already intimidating. Now you're in the base of the operation. The military will do anything to kill you. It seems that everybody's out and the security cameras are offâ€¦ for now. No time to poop your pants. Get out of here. But, be VERY careful."

[player description]

The Description of the player is "You're a normal tan-skinned person (5'10, 180 lbs), wearing clothes that you don't feel like you normally wear. They must have given you them. The pockets on these are rather large. Maybe you could store a lot of things inside. There's a huge cut in your arm."
